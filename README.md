## Overview

StoryPad is designed with simplicity in mind, both in its UI and codebase. We aimed to keep the code understandable while staying true to Flutter's principles.

1. State Management
   StoryPad uses Provider and Stateful widgets to manage its state, distinctly organized into three levels to avoid confusion:

   - Global State: Managed by [ProviderScope](lib/provider_scope.dart), disposed when the app closes.
   - View State: Managed by [ViewModelProvider](lib/widgets/view/view_model_provider.dart), disposed when the page closes.
   - Widget State: Managed by Stateful widgets, where the widget itself controls its own state and is disposed when removed from the tree.

2. MVVM Pattern
   StoryPad leverages the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern while each view is composed of three to four key files:

   - Model (optional): Represents the data structure, e.g., StoryDbModel.
   - View: Constructs the view model and builds the UI content, e.g., EditStoryView.
   - ViewContent: Displays the actual UI, keeping the visual layout separate from business logic, e.g., EditStoryContent.
   - ViewModel: Manages business logic, provides data & operations to the view, keeping the UI free from unnecessary logic, e.g., EditStoryViewModel.

3. Local Database
   StoryPad uses ObjectBox as the local database solution for persistent data storage. ObjectBox provides fast, efficient, and scalable database operations with rich search capabilities, making it ideal for mobile apps that require high-performance data handling.
